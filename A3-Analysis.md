# A3 Lighthouse Analysis
Our website is our face to the world.  As it stands we have several challenges that make it less effective than it could be. This document will analyze where Google's Lighthouse web development tool thinks we could make improvements. Lighthouse tests for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  Each of these have several subcatagories. Do to the amount of catagories and the lenght that would be required to go into detail on all catagories I will be choosing which catagories to discuss based on the largest areas of growth, and which catagories to not if we are already doing well in those areas. 
## Performance  
Performance measures how quickly our site delivers content to viewers.  This is important because if a website delivers content, especially key content, slowly it negatively effects how the viewers see the school as a whole, as well as reduces the number of people who will stay on the site to learn more about us. Google states that a load time of more than 3 seconds looses around 60% of new viewers.  

Our website is wildly inconsistent in all timed performance metrics.  Lighthouse has 3 levels, per catagory, of measured performance. Red (score of 0-49), orange (score of 50-89), and green (score of 90-100).  It can also be used to test for the destop and mobile experiences of the site. Generally speaking the desktop version is inconsistant but functional.  The Mobile version, which is the standard all websites are moving to, is less than optimal. 
#### Desktop tests
In initial, and predominatley undocumented, tests the site performed generally poorly. In the initial tests aproximately 5% of the time our site performed in the green range. About 80% of the time it performed in the orange range.  About 10% of the time our site performs in the red, or has errors that stops the tool from being able to acurately measure the performace of our site. Even within the 80% orange, the scores can change greatly, spanning the entire range of scores. Additionally, if the computer is performing other tasks the tool reads errors nearly every time.  
In more controled testing where I documented 26 tests and their performance ratings the site had 50% green, 27% orange, and 23% red or with errors.  I still consider this to be more variance than is acceptable to be able to effectively use our website for recuitment or marketing purposes.  This inconsistancy not only hurts new traffic (potential new students) but also has the potential to frustrate current students and family as the site may not work well when they need to find information. These tests are also ran on the best WiFi network available. I plan to retest on a home network and the school network to see what the variance is based on lower quality networks.  
#### Mobile tests
Simulated mobile tests have caused errors accross nearly all tests. Evidence suggests that the site was not designed for mobile applications.  This is causing major performance issues.  As a broad trend, websites are being viewed more on mobile devices than on desktop computers. Many of our students view websites only on their mobile devices. Google suggests that this trend is going to continue, and become more prominate in the near future. With a site that cannot be viewed effectively or effeciently on mobile devices, we are losing opportunities with new students, as well as slowing down current students and families who need information from our site.  

In talking to my mentor at IDX designs, he suggested that the inconsistencies and errors likely are related to the service we use to host the website.  According to him, bluehost.com, our current host is known for lagging and inconsistent delivery speeds.  This is due to their limited bandwidth and storage capabilities.  Due to the host's limitations, if another site on their server is taking up large amounts of resources, it will slow our website down.  
## Accessibility
Our site is consistently scoring in the low 60s for accessibility in both desktop and mobile tests.  We score particularly low on having "alt attributes" on images, forms are not labeled properly, and links do not have discernable names.  These issues make viewing very difficult for visually impared visitors.  "Alt tags" are a background, text discription of the image so visually impaired vistors can read a discription of the image. Form labels, and link names work similarly for their associated forms and links.  These missing tags also affect performance, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) becuase the browser only reads it as machine code and renders that code.  It cannot read and interpret that data to help lead viewers to the data that is most important to them. The lack of these attributes affects all viewers to some degree, but especially damage the viewing experience for visually impared viewers.  
Having these accessiblity issues may also put us in violation of the Rehabilitation act section 504 as well as ADA title II laws. 

Section 504 States that any educational agency recieving federal funding must follow this mandate _“No qualified [disabled] person shall, on the basis of [disability], be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity which receives Federal financial assistance.”_ 

Title II states that _"A public entity shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with applicants, participants, members of the public, and companions with disabilities are as effective as communications with others.”_

The DOE and The DOJ have both published documents stating that they are actively researching and compiling a set of web accessiblity standards that all agencies who recieve federal funding will be held to.  Currently they both recommend all federal and educational agencies use WCAG 2.0 level AA standards, according to a DOJ issues notice, these will likely be the what the DOJ and DOE standards are based on.  

If we are able to develop an updated website that meets these standards it will put us in complience with both current and future standards, as well as limit our liability that may lead to lawsuits as it has elsewhere. According to the [Center for Digital Education](https://www.govtech.com/education/Office-of-Civil-Rights-Enforces-Web-Accessibility.html) most lawsuites against school's related to web accessibility are due to lacking "alt tags", low contrast text and background colors, and missing captioning and "alt tags" in video.  Our site has been graded by Lighhouse to be lacking in the first two catagories.  

While not a part of the test per say, another area of opportunity is our mobile accessiblity.  Currently when the site is opned in a mobile browser, the site does not resize for the device.  This leaves the site about 4 times larger than an average smart phone. The size can be manually resized, but doing so makes the text too small to read easily.  This is an accessibilty issue for all users. Smart phones represent the a significant amount of web traffic.  The US Census Bureau lists 71% of households using smartphones to complete the cencus questionaire, and an equal percentage of desktop / laptop households.  This suggests that many people are using both.  Other sources suggest that around two thirds of all web traffic is done on a mobile device.  Research also suggests that it mobile devices will continue to take the lead in all web traffic.  Watching around our school, I suspect that our student usage of mobile devices to access our site and all web use is significantly higher. Currently our website is difficult to use on mobile devices, I personally have nearly stopped all use of our mobile site. The site was designed prior to mobile devices being as accessible as they are now.  And it shows.

## Best Practices
Best Practices measures a series of development standards set by Google to determine if the site is secure and up to date with current technology.  There are 15 standards measured on a pass fail basis. We currently pass 11 of those, but fail at 4 of them. Those 4 do constitute a security concern for our website.  How big of a concern those security gaps are depends largely one what information is abailable through the website.  From a user standpoint, I do not believe it is a large concern for us.  I have not personoally seen anywhere that hosts personal data, student records, nor have I seen anywhere that allows for digital payment in which a malicious outside person could steal data which would constitute a violation of students, or families personal private information.  

With that being said several of our issues are fairly easy to correct. 

"Does not use https": We are currently serving our website on old http standards.  The "s" in https stands for secure.  This means that our host is currently using minimal or no security on our site.  This is not a huge issue due to our lack of secure data on our site.  However it does open a small possibility of "man in the middle" attacks" (attacks where someone outside our network interupts the data stream to access passwords or private data) For our site that is only a concern to those who administer the site.  Potentially a malicious hacker could get our website administrator's password and modify or delete our website in ways damaging to our reputation.  I believe this is a minimal risk, however changing from http to https is free and simple making it worthwhile to do, as well as recommended by google.  Often "recommended" means google will penalize the site by lowering its ranking in search engines if the site does not meet their reommendation. 

"Does not use HTTP/2 for all it's resourses" This is a more modern technology that will help the site load faster and provide a better user experience.  

"Links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe" We currently have links that allow the site being linked to to access some of our data.  This means that if the other site is running a lot of resource intensive processes it can slow our site down.  It also opens a path to be redirected to malicious websites. 

"Includes front-end JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities" We are currently running some scripts on our site that have known security vulnerabilities.  This would allow a potential intruder access to our site. 

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
We score reasonably well in SEO (82).  SEO is designing and presenting information in a way that is accessible by google and other search engines.  This is the basis for new viewers to find our site. We do a good job of this alreay, but have a few areas of opportunity. The largest areas of opportunity are also accessibility concerns. Specifically adding alt tags to make images searchable by content, and having descriptive links so the links are also searchable. 

## Summary

While there is some good in our website, I do not believe it is serving the school in the ways we need it to. We need to develop a site that both tells the story of A3 and generates excitement within potential students.  It also needs to be accessible to all potential students and families.  This is where our greatest areas of opporutnity are. We need a site that will recruit new students.  To do that it needs to be accessible, creative, and fun.  I believe this is what our school tries to be.  Now it is time for our website to reflect who we are.
